# Alexa Monkey Weather

This is a skill for Amanzon Alexa service. You can ask Alexa for weather information as following:

> Alexa, ask Monkey Weather the weather in Shanghai today

> Alexa, ask Monkey Weather  what the weather's  in Shanghai right now

It uses HeFeng Weather  API, and can get the weather of most China citys.
